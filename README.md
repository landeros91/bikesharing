# Bike Sharing Program

## Overview
The purpose of this initiative is to provide bike sharing analysis to investors to get a better scope of the program. The intitiave demonstartes how affective is the program in one of Americas traffic congested cities, New York. In this presentation, I have used Tableau to take standard data and create visualizations that can grasp the investor to see the bike sharing vision!

The majority of bikes at 5 minute duration are males.

It seems that the bike share program is affective during morning and afternoon weekday commute.

There are less female users during weekeday commute times then men. The men hit the double digits.

There are less subscribers on Sunday. This makes sense as the program has shown effectiveness during weekday commute hours.
